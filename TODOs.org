* Pointers [0/4]
   - [ ] Basic pointers
   - [ ] Pointer math
   - [ ] Member expressions on pointers
   - [ ] String type
     
* Foreign functions [3/5]
   - [X] Call via dyncall/load
   - [X] Store a table with information about foreign functions in the stack program
   - [X] Load this table in the vm, and attempt to load the foreign functions with dynload
   - [ ] Stack command for pushing arguments for foreign functions
   - [ ] Varargs functions
    
* Statements [0/3]
   - [ ] While
   - [ ] For
   - [ ] Case

* IR [1/8]
   - [X] Argument count should be an argument for function calls
   - [ ] Cleanup the gendata situation
   - [ ] Use atoms where possible
   - [ ] Make block names unique with a counter
   - [ ] Free list for blocks
   - [ ] Prevent functions with the same name
   - [ ] Emit the number of argument for function calls as a u64 instead of a s64
          This is done with s64 right now because that's the only literal type we
          have.
